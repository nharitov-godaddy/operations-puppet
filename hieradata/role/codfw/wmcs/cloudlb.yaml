# TODO: override here the list of openstack controllers so HAproxy in cloudlb

# in the same network setup, this override here can be deleted, because it should be set elsewhere.

# We can't set this as default because this key also configures
# DNS stuff which needs the .wikimedia.org public IPv4 addresses
# However cloudservices <-> cloudcontrol network flows needs to be opened
# for the cloud-private addresses, so that's why this override here.
