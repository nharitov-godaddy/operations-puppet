community-crm - the community civicrm site

This sets up a site with a CiviCRM instance for use by the Community Growth

Currently it runs on instance in the 'cloud VPS' project 'civicrm-prototype'.

You can control this instance via https://horizon.wikimedia.org if you are a
member or admin of the project.

This is https://community-crm.wmcloud.org

The matching software is in another repo:
https://gitlab.wikimedia.org/repos/fundraising-tech/community-civicrm
