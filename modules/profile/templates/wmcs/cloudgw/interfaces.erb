# the data plane uses a VRF (l3mdev) + vlan trunk

# Can't set these sysctl via sysctl::parameters because we may be renaming the interface
# and there is a race condition between systemd-udev and systemd-sysctl
# resulting in sysctl trying to configure this before the interface exists
# See T305494 for details.
