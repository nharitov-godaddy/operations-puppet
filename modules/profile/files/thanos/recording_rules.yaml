  # Aggregated exporter metrics.

  # The "<service>_up" metrics are exported by Prometheus sidecar exporter (e.g. mysql-exporter,
  # when the service itself doesn't support Prometheus natively).
  #
  # Such metrics are used to catch conditions such as the following:
  # * the exporter itself is up and able to export metrics to Prometheus (therefore the "up" metric is 1)
  # * the exporter can't talk to the underlying service (e.g. mysql is down, thus "mysql_up" is 0)
  #
  # The label_replace function is used to attach a new "exporter" label to the aggregated metric.
  #
  # The following query will list all the "up style" metrics:
  #   count by (__name__) ({__name__=~".*_up$"})
