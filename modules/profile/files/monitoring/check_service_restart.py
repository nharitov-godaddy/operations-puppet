"""check_service_restart.py: Really, you should restart that service!

This script checks to make sure that if a configuration file was changed, the
related systemd service was also restarted so that the service can pick up and
apply the new changes.

For a more practical example: some services such as dnsdist and pdns-recursor
don't support reloading of the configuration and so their systemd service has
to be restarted whenever a configuration file changes. But restarting also
means clearing out the cache, so ideally we would like to manage such restarts
ourselves versus letting Puppet do that and because of that, any change to a
configuration file should not result in an automatic restart.

The purpose of this script is to check if a configuration file change (mtime)
is more recent than the subsequent service restart (ActiveEnterTimestamp), to
remind us to restart the service (WARNING). If the time delta between the mtime
and ActiveEnterTimestamp exceeds 24 hours (configurable), then it raises the
alert from WARNING to CRITICAL.
