# Configure a TLS terminator and load balancer for public-facing services.

# In this setting there are two classes of public services in production:
# * without LVS: services live on hosts with public IPs (e.g. alerts.w.o, icinga.w.o).
# * with LVS: services are TLS-terminated by edge caches and TLS connections are made to the
#   service's .discovery.wmnet name.

# One of the requirements is for backend host configurations to work in production as-is
# (e.g. virtualhost configuration).

# However, a few assumptions are made to keep things simple:
# * the discovery name is <service_name>.discovery.wmnet
#   (service_name is the key in 'service::catalog' hash)
# * TLS connections to backends are not validated
# * services without LVS also have an entry in service::catalog
# * the list of hosts is taken from the service::catalog "role" key
