# === Define service::docker
#
# Allows pulling a docker image from our registry, and running it.
#
# This is basically a shim to be able to run via puppet the containers we
# created for use with the new service pipeline in mind.
#
# === Parameters
#
# [*image_name*]
#   Name of the Docker image.  Default: $title
#
# [*version*] The docker image tag
#
# [*namespace*] The namespace of the image on the registry, if any
#
#   The fully qualified image name (FQIN) of the image
#   will be docker-registry.wikimedia.org/${namespace}/${image_name}
#   or docker-registry.wikimedia.org/${image_name} if the namespace
#   is undefined.
#
#
# [*port*] the IP port the service runs on, and that will be exposed
#   on. For now, the container port and the host port must be the same
#   and cannot be specified separately.
#
# [*override_cmd*] The command to run if different from what defined
#   in the images's CMD stanza.
#
# [*environment*] k-v hash of env variables to pass to the container
#
# [*volume*] Boolean. default false.
#   Whether a volume should be reserved for the configuration file. This is here
#   just to bypass a 64KB limitation of horizon, so don't use it for other
#   reasons. If set to true, then instead of bind mounting /etc/${title} from
#   the host, a named docker volume $title will be mounted. The entire lifecycle
#   management of that docker volume is left up to the user of the volume. So
#   precreate it and prepopulate it please
#
# [*bind_mounts*] Hash of strings. Defaults to empty.
#   The /etc dir (or variant see above) will always be mounted into
#   the container. $bind_mounts can be used to specify additional
#   mounts as src/dst pairs. For example:
#
#   {"/var/lib/puppet" => "/opt/puppetstuff",
#    "/usr/lib/puppet" => "/opt/otherpuppetstuff"}
#
#   All paths must be absolute and all parent directories pre-existing
#   in the container.
#
# [*host_network*] Boolean. default false.
#   Bind the container to the host's network rather than the default bridge
#   nework. From a networking point of view, this provides the same level of
#   iolation as if the container's main process was running directly on the
#   host. Note: $port is ignored when running in host network mode. Ports
#   opened within the container will be opened directly on the host without
#   a NAT translation being involved.
#
# [*runtime*] String. default undef. If set, specifies the container runtime.
#
